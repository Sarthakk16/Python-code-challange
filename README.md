Detailed Solution for the code challange

Explanation of the Code Based on the Problem Statement
Your goal is to extract unique groups from the "Additional comments" column in an Excel file, count their occurrences, and export the result to a CSV file. The provided code does exactly that in a structured and reusable way. 

Let's break it down step by step:

1️⃣ Extract Groups from Comments

Function: extract_groups_from_comments(comment)
This function takes a comment string as input.
Uses regular expressions (regex) to find the pattern:
php-template
Copy
Edit
Groups : [code]<I>XXXX </I>[/code]
Extracts the group names inside <I> ... </I> tags.
Splits multiple group names if separated by commas.
Returns a list of group names.

2️⃣ Read Excel File and Process Groups

Function: process_groups_from_excel(file_path, sheet_name='Sheet1', column_name='Additional comments')
Reads the Excel file using pandas.
Extracts the "Additional comments" column.
Loops through each row, finds the group names using extract_groups_from_comments().
Uses a Counter to count how many times each group appears.
Converts the final result into a DataFrame (table format).

3️⃣ Save the Processed Data to CSV

Function: save_results_to_csv(result_df, output_file='output.csv')
Takes the processed DataFrame and saves it to a CSV file.
The file contains two columns:
pgsql
Copy
Edit
| Group name              | Number of occurrences |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Huntingdon and Liz areas | 2                    |
| SML Group GMs           | 1                    |
| Eastend GMs             | 3                    |
Prints a confirmation message once saved.

4️⃣ Main Execution

The if __name__ == "__main__": Block
This ensures the script runs only when executed directly.
Defines the input file (Input-Data.xlsx) and output file (Output.csv).
Calls the processing and saving functions in order.

✅ What Needs to Be Done?

Ensure the Excel file (Input-Data.xlsx) exists in the script's directory.
Confirm the correct sheet name (update 'Sheet1' if necessary).
Run the script, and it will:
Extract group names from the "Additional comments" column.
Count the occurrences of each unique group.
Save the results into Output.csv.
This code is scalable because:

It works for any number of rows in the input file.
You can reuse the functions for different Excel files.
